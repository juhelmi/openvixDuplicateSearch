# openvixDuplicateSearch
Search and remove duplicate recordings acccording to meta files

Tool is in development phase and use on your own risk. If there are valuable recordings make backup before running duplicate search.

Currently this searches config file from /mnt/win_share/movie. Meaning that digibox disk is mounted to Linux and python script run at there. Target is to run later on OpenVix. 

Tested platform is OpenVix 6.6.13 and Ubuntu 24.04. Vu+ Solo SE V2 running OpenVix.

Documentation to be written better when script is tested better.
